# Hello world

My first Arduino project some longer time after I bought a starter pack with Arduino Leonardo.

It isn't complicated (apart from the wiring :D) at all but in my opinion looks quite interesting. I used HC-SR04 sensor to measure distance from nearest object â€“ if it's lower than one meter, an LED lightens up (I've used a buzzer, but it stopped working :/). DS18B20 sensor measures temperature. All mentioned data is displayed on an LCD (GDM1602A).

I've recorded a video before dismantling the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIdJh8P_pZc
